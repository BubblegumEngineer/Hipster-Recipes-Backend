# Backend API Template


## Instructions

1. Clone the repo `git clone <repo-url> <new-project-name>`
2. cd into your new project folder and run `npm i`
3. Create a new `.env` file and add the `MONGODB_URI`
4. Run the app with: `npm run dev`

### Backend Summary
Technologies:

MongoDB
Express
React
Node.js with Express.js for building the RESTful API.

CORS is enabled to allow cross-origin requests between the frontend and backend running on different ports during development.

Mongoose for MongoDB data modeling and interaction (mention this if youâ€™re using MongoDB).

Axios for handling requests between different services (mention this if applicable).

API Endpoints:

GET /recipes: Fetches all the recipes stored in the database.

GET /recipes/:id: Fetches a single recipe by its unique ID.

POST /recipes: Creates a new recipe.

PUT /recipes/:id: Updates an existing recipe by its ID.

DELETE /recipes/:id: Deletes a recipe by its ID.

Error Handling: Handles network errors and other server-side issues using custom error messages.

Database:

Describes the MongoDB schema for storing recipe data (e.g., title, ingredients, instructions).

CORS Setup:

Allows requests from different domains (like a frontend running on localhost:5173) using the cors middleware.

This backend is built with Node.js and Express.js, providing a RESTful API for managing recipes. It includes endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting recipes. The backend is connected to a MongoDB database using Mongoose for data storage and retrieval. CORS is enabled to allow cross-origin requests from the frontend during development.
